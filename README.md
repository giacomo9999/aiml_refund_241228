This is an extremely simple Python program that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that an individual from a particular population will have diabetes.  The actual code is pretty much cut-and-pasted from here:

Because I couldn't get meaningful results using the supplied data, I also wrote a JavaScript app that generates plausible customer data. It is named "randomCustGen.js" and outputs a CSV file titled "order-data.csv". There is one in the directory, which you can use or else generate your own.

Note that you will need to install the "pandas" and "sklearn" (or maybe "scikit-learn"-the name seems to have been changed) for the app to run successfully.
